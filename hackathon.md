# Veritas: neatHack build log

## Project

Veritas is an autonomous dependency intelligence and remediation agent for JavaScript/TypeScript repositories. It finds dependency changes that matter, proves whether they affect a given repo, writes a fix in an isolated workspace, recovers from failed attempts, and verifies the result.

Tagline: Verified changes. Reliable software.

Full plan: [VERITAS_PLAN.md](VERITAS_PLAN.md)

## Team

Solo.

## Stack

- TypeScript on Node.js
- Models through the hackathon LiteLLM endpoint (OpenAI-compatible)
- neatlogs for tracing agent runs
- Entire for checkpoints and entire-graph
- cfo.ai for the business plan
- SQLite for agent state

## Build log

### 2026-10-10

Completed:
- Read the hackathon rules and the docs for neatlogs, Entire and cfo.ai. Wrote VERITAS_PLAN.md.
- Installed Entire CLI 0.11.4 from the official GitHub release (checksum verified) and the entire-graph plugin v0.4.0.
- Enabled Entire in the repo with commit linking set to always, and added the entire-graph agent instructions.
- Confirmed entire-graph supports JavaScript and TypeScript semantically (imports and calls) and needs no network. Output saved in `evidence/entire/graph-capabilities-js-ts.json`.

Pending:
- neatlogs smoke test through the LiteLLM endpoint (needs API keys in `.env`).
- First Entire checkpoint.
- Public GitHub repository.

## Demo

Not built yet.

## Known limitations and next steps

- No application code yet.
- Next: Milestone 0 smoke tests, then the state store and agent skeleton (Milestone 1).
